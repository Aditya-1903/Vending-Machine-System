# Vending-Machine-System

This program was developed using fundamental C concepts 
such as control statements like while, if else, switch case, input validation, functions and input output formatting options.

It is based on the working mechanism of a vending machine. 
It allows the user to View the Menu first and then Order the item he wants with the help of the Item Codes provided in the menu. 
Once the Item Code is specified, it asks the user for the quantity of item needed and also confirms it with the user once again.
Then it prints the amount, the user has to insert into the machine to get his snack/beverage.                        
If the user inserts insufficient amount, it intimates the user to enter the right amount. 
Once the user has inserted sufficient amount, the machine gives the item ordered along with balance amount to the user! 
It then asks if the user wants to buy any other food. 
If so, then it directs the user to order, else the program terminates.
